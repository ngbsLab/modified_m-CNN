# modified_m-CNN

This is github repository for the paper "Flower Classification with Modified Multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks", on revision.
<br>
Our environment is described in "requirements.txt", this is a result of `conda list`. We implemented with python, on an anaconda virtual environment.
<br>
Try our code with the following steps : <br>
<br>1. Move your directory to `code`, and run `Modified_m-CNN.py`
More codes will be added, updating the existing ones or new ones</br>


### \*NOTE\*
1. We provide Korean translation, and a pretrained embedding for it<br>
2. We have stored image features, since we have freezed the (pretrained) VGG16,<br>
3. and images are too big to be loaded<br>
